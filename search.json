Currently, I am a research assistant with Dr. Saba Gerami, where I create and expand upon theoretical frameworks for analysing student understanding in calculus.\nOutside of academia, I enjoy reading classic novels, cooking new foods, and being outdoors. I am currently reading Nikolai Gogol’s Dead Souls. Let me know if you have any book recommendations!\nFeel free to contact me about anything via email!"

Conveying my interest with words is not the only form of expression. I hope to write, not to be judged by a reader, but for my own fulfillment.\nAs I write my first blog of 2025, I am overwhelmed with endless responsibilites. So forgive me if my blogs are few.\nChris"
