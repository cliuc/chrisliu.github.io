This is the first time in a while where I have written purely for the joy of it.

I find myself curious about a number of subjects. Conveying my interest with words is not the only form of expression. I hope to write, not to be judged by a reader, but for my own fulfillment. 

As I write my first blog of 2025, I am overwhelmed with endless responsibilites. So forgive me if my blogs are few.
