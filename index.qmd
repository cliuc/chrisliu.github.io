Welcome to my homepage!

I am Chris Liu (he/him/his), a second-year statistics & data science student at [California Polytechnic State University](https://www.calpoly.edu/) in beautiful San Luis Obispo. 

I am currently a research assistant with [Dr. Saba Gerami](https://math.calpoly.edu/saba-gerami), where I create and expand upon theoretical frameworks for analysing student understanding in calculus.

Outside of academia, I enjoy reading classic novels, cooking new foods, and being outdoors. I am currently reading [Nikolai Gogol's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Gogol) *[Dead Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Souls)*. Let me know if you have any book recommendations!

Feel free to contact me about anything via email!
