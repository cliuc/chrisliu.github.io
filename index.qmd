Welcome to my homepage!

I am Chris Liu (he/him/his), a second-year statistics & data science student at [California Polytechnic State University](https://www.calpoly.edu/){target="_blank"} in beautiful [San Luis Obispo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Luis_Obispo,_California){target="_blank"}. 

I am interested in statistical computing, data visualisation, casual inference, pedagogy, and much more. Currently, I am a research assistant with [Dr. Saba Gerami](https://math.calpoly.edu/saba-gerami){target="_blank"}, where I create and expand upon theoretical frameworks for analysing student understanding in calculus.

Outside of academia, I enjoy reading classic novels, cooking new foods, and being outdoors. I am currently reading [Nikolai Gogol's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolai_Gogol){target="_blank"} *[Dead Souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Souls){target="_blank"}*. Let me know if you have any book recommendations!

Feel free to contact me about anything via email!
